    Parameters
    ----------
    residual_matrix: 2d array like
      The matrix where each column is the difference between an experimental PDF/XRD pattern and a calculated PDF/XRD
      pattern at each grid point. Has dimensions R x M where R is the length of each pattern and M is the amount of
      patterns.

    stretching_factor_matrix: 2d array like
      The matrix containing the stretching factors of the calculated component signal. Has dimensions

    smoothness: float
      The coefficient of the smoothness term which


    smoothness_term: 2d array
      The term that ensures that smooth changes in the component signals are favored.

    component_matrix:

    sparsity

    Returns
    -------
